Preliminary observations on 20 mummies have already produced some results. It is much more convenient to examine the conditions of the human remains and the presence of objects without disturbing the mummy wrappings. In this way, we discovered very fine necklaces, bracelets and jewels in the mummies of the architect Kha, his wife Meryt and in a third mummy; blocks, probably made of bitumen, were in the left hemithorax and in the pelvis. We also noted different techniques of mummification, starting from the primitive mummies (in a crouched position) to the perfection of the mummies of Kha, his wife and the mummy presented here completely reconstructed (Plate 1). We noticed in most cases two positions, one with the arms crossed and the other with extended arms and hands at the pubis. We found in a Pre-dynastic mummy an extensive severing of the frontal bone and the upper facial area. Only in one case of a child did we notice a large hole in the occiput region, probably made in order to empty the skull by a different technique. In all the other mummies the brain-box was absolutely com plete. We found several skeletal disturbances mainly due to bad packing for transport; in one case, almost certainly, it was a result of mummy violation. In another case the mummy was in a very poor state with some bones missing and others in excess. Most of the pathological manifestations are of vertebral origin (arthritic degenerating lesions, ankylosing hyperostosis, fractures). We carried out our research in the museum with the aid of portable apparatus made by the firm of Gilardoni and we obtained some good results. But only in a few cases is it possible to reconstruct the mummy completely as we did in the case of the mummy shown here. It is not always easy to link-up the radiographs, and the small distance between source and film can result in deformation of image. We propose to continue our researches with more elaborate apparatus which will allow us to undertake more controlled radiographic work. s This paper formed one of the contributions to a Symposium on Population Biology of the Early Egyptians organized by B.
